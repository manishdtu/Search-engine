About:
What a Search Engine basically does is, it finds a particular "Sentence and its related content" on a click and then it goes on backside, it searches each word in the query and its nearest related and relevant contents that is available in Internet among millions of Web Pages. Search Engines uses Web crawling, Indexing and Searching to find the particular "search" in Internet. Though the search is far more complex,
What to Learn:
We will Understand the methods in C++ and how we have applied all the relevant topics from c++ in our code to make our "Mini Search Engine" of two Text File and how it searches through the hundreds of search elements for every "search" we make and gives our result.

Analogy between "Search Engine" vs "Mini Search Engine":
Millions of Webpages == Two Text Documents
Input Field == Input stream of your IDE
Page Rank searching == Linear Searching
Sorting == Sorting most relevant at top
UnFound Match in WebPage == Add the Unfound Search into one text document
Found match - it opens all Relevant WebPages in Browser == Found Match - it Opens One Webpage in Browser
Searching & Indexing Technique :
GOOGLE SEARCH ENGINE:
PageRank is technique used by Google Search Engine to Rank the Website based on the Number of incoming links to the website.Google Bot is used for Indexing the New Webpages and the process used is Crawling.

MINI SEARCH ENGINE:
Linear Search Technique is used to search through text files where more than 100 elements are available to search. Each of the Element is indexed and stored. When a search is made, all the relevant words searched through each element(a line) and gives out INDEX when maximum match of words in an element occurs.A match is not found then the particular is search is indexed and then added to the text file.
